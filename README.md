## Scope & Goals of Analysis

ACCO Engineered Systems is a mechanical engineering company operating in Arizona, California, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Washington. Their Training and Development department contracts several Learning Management System vendors to deliver various training programs to their employees. The Learning Data Analyst position opened for applications in March of 2025 detailing involement in the optimization of LMS and content delivery. I obtained this data set as an applicant to the position and delivered my insights to the Training and Development Team in my first-round interview. 

The **main objectives** of this analysis are to:
1. Identify associations betweeon Outcomes and Training Module Characteristics.
2. Investigate patterns in Vendor and Training Program offerings.
3. Optimize Vendor Spending.

## Dataset & Overview of Data Structure

ACCO generated a Technical Assessment data set containing 24 original columns of 150 rows. Each row represents a training module assigned to an employee, detailing assignment and training module details. 

To help explain missing data related the "Completion Date" column, I created a "Days Overdue" column that pulls information from the "Completion Status," "Assignment Date," and "Due Date" columns. Data from 25 columns were used in the analysis.

Below is the data field summary:

Conflict was also measured at the end of the year, so trends depict a one year period. Conflict also decreases overtime but students on average were already at the low end of conflict across schools, as this measure is on a 1-5 scale. 

EDA revealed that conflict with teacher was moderately correlated (-0.47 & -0.61) with students' ATL scores. Both Kindergarten and First grade models confirm this finding, revealing that students experiencing more conflict were **63%–73% less likely** to receive a ‘High’ ATL rating. Confidence intervals for both of the estimates indicate that the true population value would also reflect a decreased likelihood of receiving a "High" ATL rating.

#### Attentional Focus is a key behavioral driver of ATL — and its influence remains strong over time.
