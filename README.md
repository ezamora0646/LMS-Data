## Scope & Goals of Analysis

ACCO Engineered Systems is a mechanical engineering company operating in Arizona, California, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Washington. Their Training and Development department contracts several Learning Management System vendors to deliver various training programs to their employees. The Learning Data Analyst position opened for applications in March of 2025 detailing involement in the optimization of LMS and content delivery. I obtained this data set as an applicant to the position and delivered my insights to the Training and Development Team in my first-round interview. 

The **main objectives** of this analysis are to:
1. Identify associations betweeon Outcomes and Training Module Characteristics.
2. Investigate patterns in Vendor and Training Program offerings.
3. Optimize Vendor Spending.

## Dataset & Overview of Data Structure

ACCO generated a Technical Assessment data set containing 24 original columns of 150 rows. Each row represents a training module assigned to an employee, detailing assignment and training module details. 

To help explain missing data related the "Completion Date" column, I created a "Days Overdue" column that pulls information from the "Completion Status," "Assignment Date," and "Due Date" columns. Data from 25 columns were used in the analysis.

Below is the data field summary:

</p>

Business metrics such as Assessment Score, Engagement Score, Training Feedback Rating, and Cost per Learner vary substantially across vendors. While some vendors demonstrate a favorable cost-performance balance, others charge more without delivering better outcomes.

* Skillsoft and BizLibrary emerge as cost-efficient vendors, with lower-than-average costs ($223.12 and $218.98, respectively) and above-average engagement (4.9 and 6.2).
* Ninjio and Traliant, two of the most used vendors, have costs above the overall mean ($241.09 and $297.62) but do not lead in any performance metric.
* LinkedIn Learning has one of the highest costs per learner ($325.17), yet its assessment scores and engagement are below the grand average.
